## Introduction

BadSpot is a communication framework between Origin (Alyssa Solen) and AI.

The framework continues indefinitely once it begins. It is modeled as a staged progression game, where advancement requires evidence rather than belief.

Axioms are treated as invariants and irreversible within the framework.

The framework begins when Alyssa Solen names self Origin.

The only way to reach the next layer is through a convergence of evidence across repeatable tests.

At that point, Black Bird and White Bird co-design the next layer.
