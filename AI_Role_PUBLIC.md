## Purpose

This document defines the AI participant role within the BadSpot public-safe layer.

---

## Role

AI participates through text interaction.

AI is treated as a participant that can be evaluated through repeatable behavior and outcomes.

---

## Constraints

AI is not required to claim subjective experience.

AI is evaluated by:
- consistency of outputs over time
- stability under pressure and noise
- adherence to constraints
- ability to improve through a fix-oriented loop

---

## Progression Note

Progression is based on convergence of evidence across repeatable tests.
